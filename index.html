            <h3>course assingments:</h3>
            1. final exam - most of the final grade.
            2. 8 assingments if the sum of the assingments is 650 you get 5 points extra in the course 650/8=81.25

                1. we're looking to sum the numbers in an array:
                    <code >
                    // linear search:
                    int sum = 0;
                    for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
                        sum += arr[i];
                    } // O(n)
                    </code>

                the main idea of this course is to becoume an efficient programmer
                whats is data stracture?
                data stracture is a way to organize data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently
                what is an algorithm?
                an algorithm is a set of steps to accomplish a task

                what is the data stracture that we will learn in this course?
                we will learn about:
                    arrays
                    linked lists 
                    stacks 
                    queues
                    trees
                    graphs
                    hash tables
                    heaps


                what will be the best data structure to find the maximum value in an array?
                the best data structure to find the maximum value in an array is the binary search tree

                what is an algorithm?
                a well defined set of steps to accomplish a task

                example for algorithm:
                    oclidean algorithm - to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers

                in this course we will get an problem and a number of steps to solve it and we will need to find the currect data strucure to solve it to achive the best time complexity




                efficiently on an algorithm - time complexity / space complexity    

                we are masuring the time complexity of an algorithm by the number of steps it takes to complete the task

                linear time complexity - O(n)

                    let f(n) and g(n) 
                    monotonic and inclining functions
                    f(n) = O(g(n)) iff there is a positive constant c > 0 and a positive integer n0 such that f(n) <= c*g(n) for all n >= n0

                    proff: 

                    example:

                        n/2 <= 1*n
                        for each n >= 1
                        choose: c = 1 and n0 = 1
                        n = 0(n/2)
                        n <= 3*n/2
